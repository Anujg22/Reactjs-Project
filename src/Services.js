                    <p>Truly effective support is more about pre-emptive, proactive maintenance than it is 
                        about crisis assistance. Timely maintenance is the key to higher uptime, lower cost of
                        ownership and longer, more profitable life for the vehicle. The trust that vecv 
                        inspires hinges not only on the quality and reliability of the vehicles themselves, but 
                        on the quality and reliability of the support, whenever needed.

                        our products and services. In realising this commitment, we understand not only the need 
                        for regular repair of your vehicles but also the importance of arresting the product 
                        repair time resulting in minimum off road time. This urge to ensure maximum profitability 
                        and satisfaction for our customers coupled with the ask to keep our service force abreast 
                        with the continually changing landscapes in technology, led to the need for Service 
                        Training, an initiative that trains and empowers our service workforce to handle the most 
                        complex of vehicular services.

                        <p>
                        Since our service workforce is professionally trained, they not only help keep your 
                        vehicles in top shape, but are also catalysts for enhanced customer satisfaction. 
                        Service Training caters to the training needs across ranks: from an entry-level 
                        technician to an experienced workshop manager. They undergo intensive training 
                        programmes so as to ensure that every person among our channel partners is trained for 
                        continual improvement in their skills for higher productivity, retention and motivation.

                        The Need for Constant Service Training

                        <p>
                        The constant endeavours of our R&D engineers to bring innovative, customer-centric and 
                        commercially viable technology to the table, has made it vital to educate all the 
                        stakeholders who are going to take care of the vehicles on the same, including the 
                        owners who manage the fleet and the drivers who would actually be driving the trucks. 
                        Due to the ever-changing technology in the vehicle industry the need has also increased 
                        for service technicians to constantly upgrade their knowledge and learn how to use modern 
                        tools of diagnostics-multi-meters, scan tools and more–to service a vehicle. Without adequate 
                        training and hands-on experience on the new technologies there is going to be a huge 
                        disconnect, leading to customer dissatisfaction. Hence, it is imperative to have regularly 
                        trained, readily available technicians at every possible customer touch point.
